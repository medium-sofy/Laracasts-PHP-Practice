-Edit: Starting from today (1st of February), I've changed the organization of this repo, instead of adding all project files into a seperate folder for each lesson, I will commit each change that occurs to the files in the project root, with a number in the commit message identifying which lesson the commit belongs to. Hopefully, this will improve project organization, and eliminate duplication.
